# Verify installation

To get specific help for any specific command, use the `-help` option with the relevant subcommand. For example, to see help about the "validate" subcommand you can run `terraform validate -help`.

The inline help built in to Terraform CLI describes the most important characteristics of each command. For more detailed information, you can refer to each [command's page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands) for details.
