The `terraform state show` command is used to show the attributes of a single resource in the state file that matches the given address.
This command requires an address that points to a single resource in the state. 
Addresses are in <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/state/resource-addressing" target="_blank">resource addressing format</a>.

The output of `terraform state show` is intended for human consumption, not programmatic consumption.
