# Terraform plan

The `terraform plan` command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. By default, when Terraform creates a plan it:

- Reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date.
- Compares the current configuration to the prior state and noting any differences.
- Proposes a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration.

The `plan` command alone does not actually carry out the proposed changes You can use this command to check whether the proposed changes match what you expected before you apply the changes or share your changes with your team for broader review.

If Terraform detects that no changes are needed to resource instances or to root module output values, terraform plan will report that no actions need to be taken.
