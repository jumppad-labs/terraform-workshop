# Show state

The terraform state show command is used to show the attributes of a single resource in the state file that matches the given address.
This command requires an address that points to a single resource in the state. Addresses are in [resource addressing format](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/state/resource-addressing).

The output of terraform state show is intended for human consumption, not programmatic consumption.
