# List state

The `terraform state list` command is used to list all resources in the state file matching the given addresses (if any). 
If no addresses are given, all resources are listed.

The resources listed are sorted according to module depth order followed by alphabetical. 
This means that resources that are in your immediate configuration are listed first, and resources that are more deeply nested within modules are listed last.

For complex infrastructures, the state can contain thousands of resources. 
To filter these, provide one or more patterns to the command. 
Patterns are in [resource addressing format](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/state/resource-addressing).
